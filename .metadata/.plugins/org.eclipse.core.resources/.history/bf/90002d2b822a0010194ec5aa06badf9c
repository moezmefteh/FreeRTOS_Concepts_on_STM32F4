# GPIO Tasks with Delay Example

This example demonstrates how to create two FreeRTOS tasks that toggle an LED with different delays using STM32F4 and STM32CubeIDE.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Open the project in STM32CubeIDE**.
2. **Configure the GPIO**: Set the pin connected to the LED (e.g., PA5).
3. **Build the project**: Click **Build** in STM32CubeIDE.
4. **Flash the board**: Connect your STM32F4 development board and click **Debug**.

## Concept Demonstrated

- **FreeRTOS Tasks**: The example creates two tasks with different delays.
- **GPIO Manipulation**: Toggle an LED connected to the STM32F4 microcontroller.
- **osDelay()**: Demonstrates the use of `osDelay` for task timing.
